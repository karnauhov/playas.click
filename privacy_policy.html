      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Playas is an app for viewing up-to-date information about beaches, including meteorological data, flag signals, rules and other useful information. For the "Find nearby beaches" feature, the app may request permission to access the device's location. Location information is used exclusively to identify and display nearby beaches. Location data requested for this purpose is not stored by the app and is not transmitted to third parties. In all other respects the app does not collect, store, or transmit personal user data.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        Playas does not require registration or sign-in and does not request personal information. We do not track user activity and do not use cookies for user identification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Access to location is requested only with the user’s explicit consent and only while the user actively uses the "Find nearby beaches" feature (foreground use). We do not collect background location data and we do not store a history of user locations. The user may revoke location permission at any time via the device settings.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        Because the app does not store personal data, we do not share personal user data with third parties. Specifically: location data requested solely for finding nearby beaches is not shared with external parties.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        Because Playas does not store personal information or location history, the risk of personal data exposure is minimal. Access to location is possible only with the user’s explicit consent and only while the relevant feature is in use.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This privacy policy may be updated if the functionality of the application changes. Any updates will be made available on this page.
      </p>
